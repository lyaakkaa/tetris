# TETRIS ðŸŽ®

The game is a version of the classic Tetris game. The player controls the falling tiles, which must be placed so as to fill the horizontal rows. If the row is full, it is deleted and all remaining tiles are shifted down. The goal of the game is to score the maximum number of points.

The game implements the control of falling tiles using the arrows on the keyboard. The tile rotation function is also implemented using the "up" key.

There are different types of tiles in the game that fall randomly. Each tile consists of four squares arranged in different combinations. Tile types: L-tile, Z-tile, I-tile, T-tile, O-tile and J-tile.

The player gets points for each row collected. The more rows a player collects at a time, the more points he will get.

The player loses if at least one tile reaches the upper edge of the playing field. The game continues indefinitely until the player loses.


The game has a menu where the player can start a new game. The game also has a soundtrack, including background music.

An important feature of the game is the ability to save the player's results even after the game is closed. This means that if a player reaches a new record, his result will be saved and available to him the next time he starts the game.

In addition, the game has a global rating, which allows players to compete with each other and show their skills in front of the whole world. In the global ranking, players can see and compare their results with the best.
